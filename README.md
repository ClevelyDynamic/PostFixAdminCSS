# PostFixAdminCSS

A Simple replacement for the default CSS file for the PostFixAdmin to improve the interface.

This makes no changes to any code or any of the template files.

Hope this makes its a little better to use! If you like it, dont like it or want to help let me know. I have
included a link to my website below as well, more contact details are avaiable on there.


How to use...

Replace the postfixadmin/public/css/default.css (back it up first!!1!) with the new one, and refresh the broswer.
Should work with postfixadmin around version 3.2 and up. Obviously feel free to modify.

You can also refer to http://http://www.cleveleydynamic.co.uk/postfixadmin-css-project as well, although all the information
should be here as well.
